# GlassPass

## Description
<b>GlassPass is a private sharing hub for conference side event tickets. Earn reputation for sharing superfluous tickets you hold or secure a last-minute attendance to that one brilliant event!</b>

GlassPass gives new life to forgotten side event tickets. Most side events are oversubscribed and underattended. Those 5 simultaneous events you signed up for? Earn reputation for sharing them with those that actually want to attend. Tickets are securely encrypted on-chain and can only be claimed for 30 minutes by a new owner. The QR code can only be generated on-site as the user's geolocation is compared and verified on-chain. This gives conference-goers the ability to attend that side event that they only saw last-minute after it was sold out and it improves attendance of side events by an order of magnitude, a win-win for both sides.
